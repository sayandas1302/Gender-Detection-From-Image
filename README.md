# Gender-Detection-From-Image
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to develop a model for gender detection from human facial images, enabling automated inference of gender with high accuracy and broad applications.

### List of Files and Folders
1. 3 jupyter files for Exploratory data analysis, Pre-processing and Model building
2. 1 python file for the web application
3. 1 .pdf file for the entire project details
4. 1 text files for the dependencies
5. 1 .mp4 video file for the demonstration of the web app
6. in static folder there are .css files and the .js file for the web app and necessary folder configuration for the webapp input-output
7. in templates folder there is a .html file for the webapp template
8. 6 .rar files

 `note`: Here there are two more necessary folder that are required, one is the artfact folder that contains the the expracted information aboout the training images and their labels in .pkl format and also the trained models in .h5 format and the other folder is the dataset folder that containes the dataset. Both these two folders too large to upload in gitHub directly, so we have compressed it into 6 .rar folder.

 ### Setup the system
 To set up the system obey the following steps 
 1. download the entire directory
 2. set up a virtual environment
 3. extract all the .rar files in the same relative position of the downloaded folder
 4. install all the python dependencies that are mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file

### Run the web app
To run the web application you need to follow the following steps
1. activate the virtual environment that has been created previously
2. in the activated environment run the `webapp.py` file
3. after the file starts to run it will show a local port, paste it into any browser and enter, the app should start to run in that browser
